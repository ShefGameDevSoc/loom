Hey everyone, hope you had a good break and relaxed after any exams :)

We have a lot planned for this semester, but we don't have a lot happening just yet other than...

## Refreshers Fair

On the **11th of Feb**, Tuesday on Week 1, we'll be running a stall at the fair again from **11:00 - 15:30**. If you have any questions or just want to chat come meet us their at stall **63**. We don't have a map yet so there's no info on the exact location, but we'll make sure to post an update with it soon.

## Other Than That

We'll post out a roadmap of what's going to be happening at the end of the week, so make sure to look out for it.
