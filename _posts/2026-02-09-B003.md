Exams are over, and a new semester is starting. Now is the best time to make new friends, work on new projects, and have some fun.

ShefJamXII is a 42-hour game jam, where teams of up to 4 compete to create a game that fits our theme for the chance to win big prizes.

Whether you're a programmer, artist or designer, whether you're in it to win it or just here for the free food: ShefJam is an unforgettable weekend that you don't want to miss.

If you've never participated in a game jame or even never made a game, we will be running a workshop to help get you up to speed. Watch our socials for the details.  

Theme reveal at 6pm on Friday 13th February, and the deadline is 12pm on Sunday.
