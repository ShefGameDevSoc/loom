## GIAG: Pitch Your First Game

Ever had a great game idea but didn’t know where to start? Join us on February 20th (6PM-8PM) in Computer Room 2 for a fun, beginner-friendly Game Pitch Challenge, where you'll work in teams to create and present your own game concept based on a surprise theme: just like a Game Jam, but without the coding!

You’ll brainstorm unique ideas, develop a compelling pitch, and share it with the group. No experience needed, just bring your creativity and enthusiasm!

When: Feb 20th, Thursday, 6 - 8 PM
Where:  Computer Room 2, The Diamond
