The GameDevSoc Game Jam is Back!

Compete in a team of four in this 24 hour Game Jam. WIN PRIZES and of course get FREE PIZZA!

We will announce the theme in person in the Diamond, and we will be there until the building closes (half 9). We will be back from 9 the next morning for the final hours, judging and of course prize giving.

Come with friends or find a team there :)
